<h3>Description</h3>

I did a Redesign of the old Website, which was very old (still one of those old plain HTML Sites, which didn't look very nice).

So I created a very minimalistic Design and built it upon Wordpress, so that the Customers will be able to handle the changes on their Website by themselves.

Additionally I also did the Photographs of the Team, so they could but them online and have a nice Team Page to show off all the Employees.
