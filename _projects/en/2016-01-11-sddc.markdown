### Description

A REST API which access the underlying GenericAPI to provision Compute, Network and Storage Resources.
But since the Time was short we used a simple API to build upon the libvirt API (KVM/XEN/VMware ESX).<br>
It's possible to extend the Software with other API's like (https://jclouds.apache.org/jclouds)[jclouds] which would extend the
Software with the possibility to provision Cloud Hoster Resources.<br>
As an addition the Software also has a very simple and easy User Dashboard (Self-Service) and a Admin Dashboard to administrate the software.
