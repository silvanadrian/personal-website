### Description
A very minimalistic Clone of the Game Bomberman written in Java -> that's why there is a J :smiley:.
Well a Game has 3 rounds and whoever has the highest score will be the winner and the Game ends.
The Game can be played by up to 4 Players, but a Server is needed which supports RabbitMQ (there is a Docker Container, which can be used).
