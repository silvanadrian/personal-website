JBomberman is a very minimalistic clone of the game Bomberman written in Java.
A game has 3 rounds and whoever has the highest score will be the winner.
The game can be played by up to 4 players, but a server is needed which supports RabbitMQ (for easier deployment there is a [docker container](https://github.com/silvanadrian/jbomb-docker)).
The source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/HSR-SE2Proj/JBomberman) and is licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
