A very minimalistic Clone of the Game Bomberman written in Java -> that's why there is a J :smiley:.
Well a Game has 3 rounds and whoever has the highest score will be the winner and the Game ends.
The Game can be played by up to 4 Players, but a Server is needed which supports RabbitMQ (there is a [Docker Container](https://github.com/silvanadrian/jbomb-docker), which can be used).
The Source Code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/HSR-SE2Proj/JBomberman) and is licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
