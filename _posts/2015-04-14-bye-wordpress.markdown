![Jekyll](/img/posts/ghostjekyll.jpg)

Well as the title says I changed my Website to Jekyll and my Blog is now built with Ghost.

I just wanted something easy to build upon - Wordpress is great but has even without Plugins mostly too many functions that I just don't need.
<!--more-->
So I thought why shouldn't I go back to static sites which do not need any Database -> so in the end I chose Jekyll for it.
Which allows me generate static site upon the Layout in ERB (Embedding Ruby).

For the blog I just thought why not Ghost, which is in my opinion at the moment one of the best Blogging Platforms (the Post Editor is just great).
