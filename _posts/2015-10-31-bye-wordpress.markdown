![Jekyll](/img/posts/jekyll.png)

Well as the title says I switched my Website to Jekyll.

I just wanted something easy to build upon - Wordpress is great but has even without Plugins mostly too many functions that I just don't need.
<!--more-->
So I thought why shouldn't I go back to static sites which do not need any Database and I can host it on Github -> so in the end I chose Jekyll for it.
Which allows me generate static site upon the Layout in ERB (Embedding Ruby).
